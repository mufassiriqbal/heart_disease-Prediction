# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction App

This project is a **Machine Learning powered Heart Disease Prediction App** built with **Python & Streamlit**.  
It uses **multiple trained ML models (KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest)** to predict the likelihood of heart disease.  
The app is live on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Trained and compared **multiple models** for prediction.  
- Models stored in `.pkl` format for reuse.  
- Streamlit-based frontend (`app.py`) for interactive use.  
- Soon: Advanced frontend with more interactive visualizations.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit  
- Hugging Face Spaces

## 📊 Models Information
We trained and evaluated multiple ML models to compare performance:  

| Model             | Accuracy (mean) |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | ~97% |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | ~84% |
| **Decision Tree** | ~70% |
| **Random Forest** | ~72% |

👉 Final `.pkl` file contains all these models, so the app can be easily extended to switch between them.
